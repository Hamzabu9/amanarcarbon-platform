# Product Requirements Document: Phase 2 - Backend Platform & Core Features

## Introduction/Overview

Phase 2 focuses on building the core backend infrastructure and platform functionality for AmanarCarbon. This phase transforms the static marketing website into a fully functional carbon management platform with user authentication, database integration, API services, and the three main product modules: Carbon Marketplace, Climate Risk Intelligence, and Impact & Engagement Hub.

The goal is to create a production-ready platform that enables users to manage their carbon footprint, buy/sell carbon credits, access climate risk intelligence, and engage with the carbon management community.

## Goals

1. **Backend Infrastructure**: Establish robust database, authentication, and API foundation
2. **User Management**: Implement comprehensive user registration, profiles, and role-based access
3. **Carbon Marketplace**: Enable carbon credit trading, project submission, and verification workflows
4. **Climate Risk Intelligence**: Deploy AI-powered risk assessment and predictive analytics
5. **Impact & Engagement Hub**: Build community features, impact tracking, and engagement tools
6. **Payment Integration**: Implement Stripe payment processing for carbon credit purchases
7. **Data Management**: Create comprehensive data models for projects, users, transactions, and analytics
8. **API Development**: Build RESTful APIs for all platform functionality
9. **Security & Compliance**: Implement enterprise-grade security and data protection
10. **Performance & Scalability**: Ensure platform can handle growth and high user loads
