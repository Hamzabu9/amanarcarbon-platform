# Product Requirements Document: Phase 1 - Foundation & Architecture

## Introduction/Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundational infrastructure for the AmanarCarbon platform by migrating from the current Vite-based static website to a full-stack Next.js 15 application with database integration, authentication, and core API architecture. This phase transforms the existing marketing website into a scalable platform foundation that supports the comprehensive carbon management features outlined in the SAD.

**Problem Statement:** The current static website lacks the backend infrastructure, database, authentication, and API architecture required to support the full AmanarCarbon platform as specified in the SAD.

**Goal:** Create a robust, scalable foundation that enables the development of advanced carbon management features in subsequent phases.

## Goals

1. **Technology Migration**: Successfully migrate from Vite to Next.js 15 with App Router while preserving existing UI components
2. **Database Foundation**: Implement PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and core schema models
3. **Authentication System**: Establish secure user authentication with NextAuth.js and Google OAuth
4. **API Architecture**: Create scalable API structure with proper middleware and error handling
5. **Development Environment**: Set up comprehensive development tooling and environment configuration

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to work with Next.js 15 and App Router so that I can leverage modern React features and routing
- I want to use Prisma ORM so that I can interact with the database using type-safe queries
- I want to have proper environment configuration so that I can develop securely with external services
- I want to have comprehensive testing setup so that I can ensure code quality

### As a System Administrator
- I want to have proper authentication middleware so that I can secure API endpoints
- I want to have database migrations so that I can manage schema changes safely
- I want to have logging and monitoring so that I can track system health

### As a Future User
- I want to be able to authenticate securely so that I can access the platform safely
- I want the platform to be performant so that I can have a smooth user experience

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Technology Stack Migration
1.1. The system must migrate from Vite to Next.js 15 with App Router
1.2. The system must preserve all existing React components and functionality
1.3. The system must implement TypeScript configuration for Next.js
1.4. The system must set up proper routing with App Router structure
1.5. The system must maintain TailwindCSS styling and design system

### 2. Database Setup

2.2. The system must implement Prisma ORM with connection management
2.3. The system must create core database models (User, Profile, Session, Account)
2.4. The system must implement database migrations for schema management
2.5. The system must set up database seeding for initial data

### 3. Authentication System
3.1. The system must integrate NextAuth.js for authentication
3.2. The system must implement Google OAuth provider
3.3. The system must handle user sessions securely
3.4. The system must provide user registration and login flows
3.5. The system must implement JWT token management

### 4. API Architecture
4.1. The system must create Next.js API routes structure
4.2. The system must implement authentication middleware
4.3. The system must provide error handling and validation
4.4. The system must create health check endpoints
4.5. The system must implement input validation with Zod

### 5. Environment Configuration
5.1. The system must set up environment variables management
5.2. The system must implement secure configuration handling
5.3. The system must provide development and production configurations
5.4. The system must set up logging and monitoring

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced carbon management features (deferred to Phase 2)
- Payment processing integration (deferred to Phase 2)
- External service integrations (deferred to Phase 3)
- Role-based dashboards (deferred to Phase 2)
- Carbon credit marketplace (deferred to Phase 3)
- AI/ML services (deferred to Phase 3)
- Production deployment (deferred to Phase 4)
- Comprehensive testing suite (deferred to Phase 4)

## Design Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- Maintain existing component structure and styling
- Implement proper Next.js App Router patterns
- Ensure responsive design compatibility
- Preserve existing user experience

### Backend Architecture
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use service layer pattern for business logic
- Ensure API security and validation

### Database Design
- Implement core user management models
- Prepare for future feature expansion
- Ensure data integrity and relationships
- Optimize for performance

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Zod for schema validation
- TypeScript for type safety

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Database query optimization
- Proper caching strategies

### Security Requirements
- Secure authentication flow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment variable protection
- SQL injection prevention

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Successful migration of all existing components
- Database connection and basic CRUD operations working
- Authentication flow functional
- API endpoints responding correctly
- Development environment fully operational

### Quality Metrics
- Zero breaking changes to existing UI
- All existing functionality preserved
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Proper error handling implemented
- Environment configuration secure

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement any specific user roles in Phase 1, or start with basic user/admin?
2. Do we need to implement any specific API endpoints beyond basic CRUD operations?
3. Should we include any specific monitoring or logging tools in Phase 1?
4. Do we need to prepare for any specific external service integrations?
5. Should we implement any specific performance optimizations in Phase 1?
